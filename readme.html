Fiber Laser Music Engraver (Fork of Baylor)
This project extends Baylor to enable image-based engraving with synchronized chip tune–style audio playback. The software converts an AI-generated image (e.g., from Stable Diffusion) into a laser modulation score, allowing a MOPA fiber laser to engrave the image while producing controlled tones via speed modulation.

Features
🎨 AI Art to Laser Engraving – Engrave an AI-generated image using a fiber laser.
🎵 Laser-Cut Chip Tune – The laser’s cutting noise produces musical notes.
🏎 Speed-Modulated Audio Control – The engraving process is mapped to controlled speed variations that generate tones.
🛠 Fully Customizable – Modify mappings for different sounds and engraving styles.
