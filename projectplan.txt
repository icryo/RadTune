Detailed Software Development Plan
1. Repository Setup
Fork the Baylor Repository:

Fork the existing baylor repository.
Clone your fork to your development environment.
Environment Preparation:

Set up a Python virtual environment.
Install dependencies required by baylor (and add any new ones, e.g., Pillow for image processing, NumPy for data handling).
Verify that the existing example (drawing a square) runs successfully on your setup.
2. Project Architecture & File Structure
Create a modular structure that separates the laser control logic, image processing, and score mapping. For example:

bash
Copy
/project-root
 ├── README.md
 ├── requirements.txt
 ├── setup.py
 ├── main.py                # Main entry point that ties everything together
 ├── lib/
 │    ├── __init__.py
 │    ├── image_processor.py   # Handles loading, converting, and pixelating the image
 │    ├── score_mapper.py      # Converts pixel data into a sequential score (commands)
 │    └── laser_controller.py  # Wraps baylor's Sender and integrates the new tick() logic
 └── tests/
      ├── __init__.py

      └── test_laser_controller.py
3. Module Development
3.1. Image Processing Module (lib/image_processor.py)
Responsibilities:

Load an image file (e.g., PNG, JPEG) generated by Stable Diffusion.
Convert the image to grayscale (if needed) to simplify the mapping.
Pixelate (downsample) the image to a grid of a specified resolution.
(For example, reduce the image to 50×50 pixels to create discrete “notes”.)
Return the pixel data as a 2D array or list of pixel brightness values.
Key Functions:

def load_and_pixelate(image_path: str, grid_size: Tuple[int, int]) -> List[List[int]]:
Use Pillow (PIL) to load the image.
Resize the image to the desired grid dimensions.
Return the resulting 2D array of pixel intensity values (0–255).
3.2. Score Mapping Module (lib/score_mapper.py)
Responsibilities:

Take the pixel data from the image processor.
Map each pixel’s brightness (or other attribute) to a laser modulation parameter:
Primary mapping: Pixel brightness → Laser travel speed.
Optional mapping: Pixel brightness or position → Laser pulse frequency (if fine tuning is desired).
Generate a sequential “score” where each step contains:
Target X, Y coordinates in the laser’s coordinate space.
A modulation parameter (e.g., travel speed) that has been calibrated to produce a specific audible tone.
Define a path–for instance, scan the pixel grid row by row (or using a custom pattern) to form the engraving trajectory.
Key Functions:

def map_pixels_to_score(pixel_data: List[List[int]], speed_range: Tuple[int, int]) -> List[ScoreCommand]:
ScoreCommand might be a simple dataclass:
python
Copy
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class ScoreCommand:
    x: int
    y: int
    speed: int  # travel speed setting, mapped from pixel brightness
    # Optionally, add other fields (e.g., frequency modulation) if needed.
Map pixel values (0–255) linearly (or using a calibrated lookup table) into a desired speed range.
Calculate X, Y positions in the laser’s coordinate system (this may involve scaling and offset adjustments based on the metal substrate size).
3.3. Laser Controller Module (lib/laser_controller.py)
Responsibilities:

Wrap and extend baylor’s Sender class to incorporate our custom “score” and tick function.
Provide an interface that:
Loads the score (list of ScoreCommand objects).
Runs a job that iterates through the score and sends commands to the laser hardware.
Implements proper error handling and resource cleanup.
Key Functions:

def run_laser_job(score_data: List[ScoreCommand], cor_table_path: str, iterations: int):
Open the connection using baylor’s Sender:
python
Copy
from baylor.sender import Sender
sender = Sender(cor_table=open(cor_table_path, 'rb').read())
sender.open()
Define a tick(cmds, loop_index) function that:
Clears previous commands.
Determines the current command from score_data based on loop_index.
Sets the travel speed using cmds.set_travel_speed(current_command.speed).
Sends movement commands using cmds.light(...) to move the laser head to the current_command.x and current_command.y coordinates.
(Optionally, if more than one command per tick is needed, combine several pixel commands into a continuous motion.)
Create a job with:
python
Copy
job = sender.job(tick=lambda cmds, loop_index: tick(cmds, loop_index))
Execute the job for the number of iterations equal to the length of the score.
Ensure that on exception (like KeyboardInterrupt) the sender is closed properly:
python
Copy
try:
    job.execute(len(score_data))
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Interrupted.")
finally:
    sender.close()
3.4. Main Application (main.py)
Responsibilities:

Parse command-line arguments (e.g., image path, grid size, speed range, cor_table path).
Call the image processor to load and pixelate the image.
Use the score mapper to convert pixel data to a score.
Invoke the laser controller to run the job.
Example Outline:

python
Copy
import argparse
from lib.image_processor import load_and_pixelate
from lib.score_mapper import map_pixels_to_score
from lib.laser_controller import run_laser_job

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Fiber Laser Image & Audio Score Engraver")
    parser.add_argument('--image', required=True, help="Path to the Stable Diffusion generated image")
    parser.add_argument('--grid', type=int, nargs=2, default=[50, 50], help="Pixel grid size (width height)")
    parser.add_argument('--speed_range', type=int, nargs=2, default=[1000, 3000], help="Laser travel speed range")
    parser.add_argument('--cor_table', default="balor/default.cor", help="Path to the cor_table file")
    args = parser.parse_args()

    # Process the image
    pixel_data = load_and_pixelate(args.image, tuple(args.grid))
    
    # Map image pixels to a laser score
    score_data = map_pixels_to_score(pixel_data, tuple(args.speed_range))
    
    # Run the laser job with the generated score
    run_laser_job(score_data, args.cor_table, iterations=len(score_data))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
4. Testing and Calibration
Unit Testing:

Create unit tests in the /tests directory to validate:
The correctness of image pixelation.
The mapping function’s output (e.g., given a fixed pixel value, verify that the speed falls within expected limits).
The laser controller’s tick function (simulate command outputs without hardware).
Calibration Mode:

Provide a “dry-run” or debug mode where the tick function logs the commands (e.g., coordinates and speeds) instead of sending them to hardware. This can help fine-tune the mapping between pixel values and modulation parameters.
Hardware Calibration:

Once the software is stable, run test engravings on the actual MOPA fiber laser.
Record the audible output of various travel speeds and adjust the mapping function if needed.
5. Documentation and Code Comments
Inline Documentation:
Use docstrings and inline comments to explain the purpose of functions and the mapping logic.
README File:
Provide a README.md in the project root explaining:
How to set up the project.
How to run the application (with example command lines).
Calibration instructions and tips.
An overview of how the image is transformed into a laser “score.”
6. Future Enhancements
Graphical Preview:
Consider building a GUI to preview the engraving path and simulate the audio modulation before running on hardware.
Extended Mapping Options:
In later iterations, extend the mapping to use additional image properties (like color channels) to control frequency modulation or additional laser parameters.
Interactive Live Mode:
Develop a live mode that allows real-time adjustments during engraving (if you plan on a live art performance).
Final Notes
This plan gives you a complete roadmap from forking baylor to producing a fully integrated fiber laser software application that takes a Stable Diffusion image, processes it into a pixelated score, and drives the laser in a way that produces an audible chip tune–style performance via modulation of travel speed (and frequency if needed). Hand this document off to your agentic coding bot, and it should be able to create the necessary modules, integrate with the baylor code, and build the system according to these specifications.

Good luck with your art-first, laser-driven musical engraving project!
